# Enigma Machine Decoder

# Overview

The Enigma Machine Decoder is a Java-based project inspired by the cryptographic device used during World War II. The Enigma machine was employed by the German military to encrypt and decrypt secret messages, contributing significantly to the complexity of wartime communication.

## Features

- *Enigma Algorithm Simulation:* This project simulates the functioning of the Enigma machine, allowing users to encode and decode messages using historical rotor settings.
  
- *User-Friendly Interface:* A simple and intuitive command-line interface facilitates easy interaction with the Enigma machine, enabling users to input custom messages for encryption and decryption.

- *Historical Accuracy:* The project aims to maintain historical accuracy by implementing the Enigma machine's rotor configurations and reflect the cryptographic challenges faced during World War II.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the enigma_decoder.py script.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input your message and configure the Enigma machine settings.
4. Witness the magic of decrypting messages just like the codebreakers of the past!

Feel free to explore the codebase, experiment with different rotor settings, and delve into the history of cryptography.
