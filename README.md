# Enigma Machine Decoder

# Overview

The Enigma Machine Decoder is a Java-based project inspired by the cryptographic device used during World War II. The Enigma machine was employed by the German military to encrypt and decrypt secret messages, contributing significantly to the complexity of wartime communication. This project focuses use concepts of OOPs to structurally solve the problem.

## Features

- *Enigma Algorithm Simulation:* This project simulates the functioning of the Enigma machine, allowing users to encode (saved in input.txt) and decode (save in output.txt) messages using historical rotor settings.
  
- *Interface:* A simple and intuitive command-line interface facilitates easy interaction with the Enigma machine, enabling users to input custom messages for encryption and decryption.

- *Historical Accuracy:* The project aims to maintain historical accuracy by implementing the Enigma machine's rotor configurations and reflect the cryptographic challenges faced during World War II.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Save your input text in input.txt
3. Run the Simulator.java and give the rotor settings properly. 
4. See the screen if encoding was successful or not. If successful then your output is in output.txt.
5. If you give the output of your input back as input with the same rotor settings you will get the exact same thing you gave as the first and initial input.
6. Witness the magic of decrypting messages just like the codebreakers of the past!

Feel free to explore the codebase, experiment with different rotor settings, and delve into the history of cryptography.
